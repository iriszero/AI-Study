## Comment

## Abstract
* Utilizes micro neural network & global average pooling
* Easier to interpret and less prone to overfitting

## 1. Introduction
### [Statistical meaning of *latent*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_variable)
As opposed to *observable variable*, it is not directly observed but are rather inferred through mathematical model

* mlpconv layer - MLP consisting of multiple FC layers with nonlinear activation functions
* Via ***a global average pooling layer***, output the spatial average of the feature maps from the last mlpconv layer  as the confidence of categories.
* FC layers are prone to overfitting and heavily depend on dropout regularization, whereas a global average pooling layer is itself a structural regularizer and prevents overfitting.

## 2. Convolutional Neural Networks
* Maxout network imposes the prior that instances of a latent concept lie within a convex set in the input space, which does not necessarily hold.
* Sliding a micro network over the input

## 3. Network In Network
### 3.1 MLP Convolution Layers
* Replaces the GLM to convolve over the input

$$
f_{i,j,k_1}^1 = \max({w_{k_1}^1}^Tx_{i,j} + b_{k_1}, 0)
$$
$$
...
$$
$$
f_{i,j,k_n}^n = \max({w_{k_n}^n}^Tf_{i,j}^{n-1} + b_{k_n}, 0).
$$

* In case of maxout,
$$
f_{i,j,k}^n = \max_m({w_{k_m}}^Tx_{i,j})
$$

* mlpconv layer differs from maxout layer in that the convex function approximator is replaced by a universal function approximator.

## 3.2 Global Average Pooling
* Replaces FC layers in CNN
* No parameters to optimize thus overfitting is avoided at that layer.\
* More robust to spatial translations
