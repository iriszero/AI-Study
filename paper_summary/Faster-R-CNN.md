## Comment
It achieves *translation-invariance*. It can perform real-time detection.
It is not clearly a priori in terms of the convergence of shared (of RPN and Fast R-CNN) network

## Abstract
*Reason Proposal Network (RPN)* shares full-image convolutional features with the detection network, enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. FC network simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. It can detect in 5-17 fps and gains 70.4% mAP using 300 proposals per immage.

## 1. Introduction
* Region proposals are the computational bottleneck. In Faster R-CNN, the proposal computation is nearly cost-free given network's computation.
* Like Fast R-CNN, RPNs is constructed by adding two additional conv layers
	* one that encodes each conv map position into a short feature vector
	* one that, at teach conv map position, outputs an objectness score and regressed bounds for $k$ region proposals relative to various scaless and aspect ratio (practically, $k=9$)
* To unify RPNs with Fast R-CNN object detectoin networks, it alternates between fine-tuning for the region proposal task and then fine-tuning for object detection, while keeping the proposals fixed.

## 2. Related Work
* OverFeat method predicts the box coordinates for the localization task that assumes a single object. The fc layer detects multiple class-specific objects.
* MultiBox methods generate region proposals which are simultaneously predicted with multiple (e.g, 800) boxes.
* Shared computation is widely used for efficient, yet accurate visual recognition.

## 3. Region Proposal Networks
* It takes an image of any size as input and outputs a set of rectangular object proposals with objectness score.
* The ultimate goal is to share compuation with a Fast R-CNN object detection network
* A box-regression layer *(reg)* and a box-classification layer *(cls)*

### Translation-Invariant Anchors
* At each sliding-window, sized $n \times n$ (e.g $n=3$), it simultaneously predict $k$ region proposals. *reg* has $4k$ outputs, $cls$ does $2k$ scores of objectness / non-objectness for each proposal. 
* The $k$ proposals are parameterized *relative* to $k$ reference boxes, called ***anchors***.
* For a conv feature map of size $W \times H$ (typically ~2,400) there are $WHk$ anchors in total.
* Practically, it uses 3 scales and 3 aspect ratios, yielding $k=9$ anchors at each sliding position.
* Both in terms of the anchors and the functions, it is ***translation invariant***, computing proposals relative to the *anchors*.

### A Loss Function for Learning Region Proposals
* It assigns a postive label to two kinds of anchors:
	* the anchor(s) with the highest IoU with a ground-truth box
	* an anchor that has IoU higher than $0.7$ with any ground-truth box
* It assigns a negative label to non-positive anchor if IoU is lower than 0.3 for all ground-truth boxes.
* This implies there can be neither positive nor negative anchors which do not contribute to the training objective at all.
* The loss function for an image is,
$$
L(\{p_i\},\{t_i\}) = \frac{1}{N_{cls}} \sum_i L_{cls} (p_i, p_i^*) + \lambda \frac{1}{N_{reg}} \sum_i p_i^* L_{reg}(t_i, t_i*)
$$
where $i$ is the index of an anchor in a mini-batch and $p_i$ is the predicted probabilty of anchor $i$ being an object,
the ground-truth label $p_i^*$ is 1 if the anchor is positive, and is 0 if the anchor is negative,
$t_i$ is predicted bounding box, and $t_i^*$ is the ground-truth box,
$L_{reg}(t_i,t_i^*)=R(t_i - t_i^*)$ where R is the robust loss function.
* For regression,
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
t_x 		& t_y 		&t_w 		&t_h \\
t_x^*	& t_y^* 	&t_w^* 	&t_h^*
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
(x-x_a)/w_a		& (y-y_a)/h_a 	& \log(w/w_a)		&\log(h/h_a)\\
(x^*-x_a)/w_a	& (y^*-y_a)/h_a 	& \log(w^*/w_a)	&\log(h^*/h_a)
\end{bmatrix}
$$
* In previous works, a bounding-box regression is performed on features pooled from *arbitrarilty* sized regions, and the regression weights are *shared* by all region sizes.
* In Faster R-CNNm, the feature has the *same* spatial size ($n \times n$) on the feature maps. To account for varying sizes, a set of $k$ bounding-box regressors are learned. Each regressor is reponsible for one scale and one aspect ratio, and the $k$ regressors do not share weights. It is still possible to predict boxes of various sizes even though the features are of a fixed size/scale.

### Optimization
The RPN is likely to bais towards negative samples as they are dominate, it randomly samples 256 mini-batches with keeping the ratio of *up to* $1:1$ (pos:neg)

### Sharing Conv Features for Region Proposals and Object Detection
* It is not easy to define a single network that includes both RPN and Fast R-CNN and to optimize it jointly with backpropagation. Neither is it clearly a priori if learning Fast R-CNN while simulatenously changing the proposal mechanism will converge.
* Here is pragmatic 4-step training algorithm via alternating optimization
	1. Train RPN as described above, initialzed with an ImageNet pre-trained model and fine-tuned end-to-end for the proposal.
	2. Train a separate detection network by Fast R-CNN using the proposals generated by step-1 RPN. It is also initailzed with the pre-trained from step-1.
	3. Use detection network to initialize RPN training, but fixing the sharable conv layers and only fine-tuning the unique layers of RPN.
	4. Keeping the shared conv layers fixed, fine-tune the fc layers of the Fast R-CNN.
